# Adding a User with jQuery - jQuery Intermediate - Coding Dojo
Demo of Coding Dojo's 'Adding User' assignment in Advanced jQuery section of Coding Dojo learning platform.

This demo uses the .on(), .append() and .val() functions in jQuery to take a user's information from an input field, and appends that data to a table above when the "Add User" button is clicked.

There are 3 areas for improvement for this demo:

1) There should be form validation so that user's can't submit the form unless all fields are properly filled out.

2) On top of this, the text fields for email address and phone number should also be validated for proper formatting (@ mark, etc.)

3) Submitting the info should be sent to a database so that it is stored.

In the future, given more time to work on this, I'd like to implement these improvements.
